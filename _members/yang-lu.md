Before starting my own lab, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Noble Research Lab](https://noble.gs.washington.edu) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu). I earned my Ph.D. in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics from the  [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu). Before that, I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn).
