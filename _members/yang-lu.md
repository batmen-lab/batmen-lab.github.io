I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Cheriton School of Computer Science at University of Waterloo. 

Before starting my own lab, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Noble Research Lab in University of Washington. I earned my Ph.D. in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics from University of Southern California. Before that, I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
