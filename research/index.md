# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research

We formulate the biological problems in genomics and proteomics as interesting computational problems and develop novel computational methods to solve these problems. We are particularly interested in developing interpretable machine learning models to make sense of complex biological data. We are also interested in finding scientifically interesting and statistically confident hypotheses by interpreting these models. See the overview of my research and recent publications below.
