We tackles the challenges of data-intensive biology, which span data collection, data interpretation, hypothesis generation, and hypothesis testing. These challenges are biological (e.g., sensitively discovering biological patterns), computational
(e.g., effectively integrating heterogeneous data), analytical (e.g., effortlessly generating testable hypotheses),
statistical (e.g., confidently teasing out hypotheses without drowning in false positives), and even ecological
(e.g., elaborately building reusable software tools).
